# JGroganPortfolio
## My Porfolio :  __By Jessie Grogan__

## Created and designed with the help of Bootstrap 4, Fontawesome, Google Fonts, Unsplash, and Visual Studio Code Editor (the editor of my choice).

###### I wanted to create this website from scratch and infuse or incorporate the different languages and skills I have aquired. There are a few projects connected to this website that show Javascript being used; However, this website is purely HTML and CSS with the help from the above listed developer services. I hope you enjoy my website and I am always looking to improve myself and learn! Happy Coding!
